* Construct a prompt that creates the app, according to your 01-app-design.md and your desired technologies (if any). Dump any specifications you find important for implementation and iterate on the plan using the AI. Mention that the app should be build in the 10-app directory for example.
* TIP: if you know what tech stack you want to use, you could opt to initalize the 'hello world' variant of that app first. For example, for a web app use: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite. That way the AI can more easily implement it since it will recognize the strucutre and dependencies. This will also reduce the amount of tasks the AI has to perform on the command line by itself, as some steps sometimes require manual input. But you are free to use what you fancy.
