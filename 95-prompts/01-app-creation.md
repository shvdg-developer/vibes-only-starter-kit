> This is a placeholder prompt to help you generate the first version of your app. Replace it with your own prompt when you're ready to build.
>
> Guidance:
> - Reference your design draft in `90-design/01-app-design.md`.
> - Specify the desired tech stack (or allow the AI to propose one).
> - Ask the AI to scaffold the app into `10-app/`.
> - Prefer small iterations: generate, run, review, and refine.
>
> Tip:
> - If you already know your stack, bootstrap a "hello world" first, for example, use: [Tailwind + Vite](`https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite`). This benefits you in two ways: 1.) you can confirm that you are able to run the app before altering it with AI, and 2.) the AI recognizes the structure and dependencies, which is then easier to expand upon, allowing it to focuss on the features.
